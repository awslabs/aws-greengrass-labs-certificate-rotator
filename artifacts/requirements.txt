# Requirements for the Greengrass component. 
#
# In general, we prefer to use the latest version of cryptography for which pre-built
# wheels exist, including the Raspberry Pi (https://piwheels.org/project/cryptography/).
#
# However, if you elect to use a version for which no pre-built wheel exists
# for your target device, then the first deployment of this component will build
# the wheel. This build requires that the Rust compiler be already installed on the
# target core device before deploying the certificate rotator component. 
# 
# If you need to install Rust on your target core device, please use the rustup 
# installer (https://rustup.rs/) and take care to install Rust for your Greengrass
# user (usually ggc_user). For example:
#
# sudo su ggc_user
# curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
#
# The Rust installation also then needs to added to your system path. This can be
# done by adding /home/ggc_user/.cargo/bin to the secure_path variable in the
# /etc/sudoers file.
